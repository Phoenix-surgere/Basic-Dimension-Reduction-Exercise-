# Basic-Dimension-Reduction-Exercise-
This is my first project upload on github, which focuses on applying some basic Dimension Reduction and visualization techniques, for practice reasons mostly, on a rather 'easy' dataset. It also aims to get me some practice with Classificiaton and other models (like XGBoost) and hyperparameter tuning techniques (like Bayesian optimization) which I haven't yet had the chance to play with.
