# Basic-Dimension-Reduction-Exercise-
This is my first project upload on github, which focuses on applying some basic Dimension Reduction and visualization techniques, for practice reasons mostly, using the Pima Indian's Diabetes' dataset. It also aims to get me some practice with Classification and other models (like XGBoost) and hyperparameter tuning techniques (like Bayesian optimization) which I haven't yet had the chance to play with.
